        "\n",
        "Ans:-When comparing YouTube with common UI/UX best practices, most of its design choices match modern standards, but there are also a few areas where it could improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Typography\n",
        "YouTube uses a clean and readable sans-serif font across the whole platform. The text style stays consistent. Video titles are bold and large, while channel names and other information like views are smaller. This follows basic typography rules and creates a good hierarchy.\n",
        "Weak point: On mobile screens, long titles often get cut off, which can make them harder to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. UI Components\n",
        "Buttons, icons, dropdowns, and menus on YouTube follow a consistent look. The “Subscribe” button and other controls like like/share are easy to recognize and use. They also have proper spacing and are easy to interact with.\n",
        "Weak point: Under the video, many buttons appear close together, which can make the section look a bit crowded.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Responsive Layout\n",
        "YouTube adjusts well to different screen sizes. On desktop, it shows multiple video columns and a full sidebar. On tablets, the number of columns reduces, and on mobile it becomes one column with a bottom navigation bar. This fits standard responsive design practices.\n",
        "Weak point: On smaller tablets, the grid can feel slightly tight because the thumbnails become closely packed.\n",

        "4. Accessibility\n",
        "YouTube performs well in accessibility. It has captions, good contrast, keyboard shortcuts, and support for screen readers.\n",
        "Weak point: Some text, especially in comments or metadata, can feel a little small for some users."
